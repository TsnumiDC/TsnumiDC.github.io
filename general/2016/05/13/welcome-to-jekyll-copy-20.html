    <p>I used to rule the world 
大千世界曾由我主宰
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
巨浪也曾因我之命澎湃
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
而今我却在黎明独自入眠
Sweep the streets I used to own 
在曾属于我的大道落寞徘徊</p>

<p>I used to roll the dice 
大千世界曾由我主宰
Feel the fear in my enemy’s eyes 
尽情品味惊恐在死敌瞳孔绽开
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
欣然倾听百姓高歌喝彩
“Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!” 
“先王亡矣！”“新王万代！”
One minute I held the key 
此刻我手握权位经脉
Next the walls were closed on me 
转瞬才知宫墙深似海
And I discovered that my castles stand 
恍然发现我的城池
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand 
基底散如盐沙乱似尘埃</p>

<p>I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
听那耶路撒冷钟声传来
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海
Be my mirror my sword and shield 
担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌
My missionaries in a foreign field 
我的传教士屹立边疆之外
For some reason I can not explain 
只因一些缘由我无法释怀
Once you go there was never, never an honest word 
一旦你离开这里便不再,不再有逆耳忠言存在
That was when I ruled the world 
而这便是我统治的时代</p>

<p>It was the wicked and wild wind 
凛冽邪风呼啸袭来
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
吹散重门使我深陷阴霾
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
断壁残垣礼崩乐坏
People could not believe what I’d become 
世人不敢相信我已当年不再
Revolutionaries Wait 
起义大军翘首期待
For my head on a silver plate 
有朝一日我站上断头台
Just a puppet on a lonely string 
恰如傀儡随吊线寂寞摇摆
Oh who would ever want to be king? 
悲哉，谁又曾渴望万人膜拜？</p>

<p>I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
听那耶路撒冷钟声传来
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海
Be my mirror my sword and shield 
担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌
My missionaries in a foreign field 
我的传教士屹立边疆之外
For some reason I can not explain 
只因一些缘由我无法释怀
I know Saint Peter won’t call my name 
我亦知天堂之门不会为我敞开
Never an honest word 
不再有逆耳忠言存在
But that was when I ruled the world 
而这便是我统治的时代</p>

<p>(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh) 
(哦哦哦)
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
听那耶路撒冷钟声传来
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海
Be my mirror my sword and shield 
担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌
My missionaries in a foreign field 
我的传教士屹立边疆之外
For some reason I can not explain 
只因一些缘由我无法释怀
I know Saint Peter won’t call my name 
我亦知天堂之门不会为我敞开
Never an honest word 
不再有逆耳忠言存在
But that was when I ruled the world 
而这便是我统治的时代</p>
